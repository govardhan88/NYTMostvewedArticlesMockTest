Perform the following steps to import your project.

## Step 1: Install git for Windows
It can be downloaded for free from git-scm.com.

Most settings available during the installation process should be compatible with Android studio. Just choose the settings you deem the most appropriate.

## Step 2: Link git executable to Android Studio
Open Android Studio and got to Settings. In the Setting dialog open the page Version Control / Git. Here define the path to the git executable you have just installed.



## Step 3: Get the Path to your Repository from Github
Go to the GitHub page and get the HTTPs path to your repository

ie., https://github.com/govardhan88/NYTMostvewedArticlesMockTest.git

## Step 4: Import the Git project to Android Studio
Go to Android Studio and go to Menu / VCS / Checkout from Version Control / Git



Paste the HTTPS path you obtained from GitHub in the previous step and click on [Clone].



Provide your GitHub username and password.



Now the project should be imported to Android Studio and you should be able to commit and push future changes back to GitHub.
